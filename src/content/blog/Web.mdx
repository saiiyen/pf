I want to thank all the good people on the web—all the kind, inspiring souls who make the internet a better place.

While I’m fully responsible for everything I create, I draw massive inspiration and pride from fellow developers and their incredible work. This space wouldn’t exist without them.

Huge shoutout and love to all the amazing people who push boundaries, share their knowledge, and keep the creative fire alive. You inspire me to strive harder, build better, and never stop learning.
